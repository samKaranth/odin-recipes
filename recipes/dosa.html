        <p>Make super crispy Masala Dosa at home with this easy dosa batter at home!
            This is a one bowl batter which is made using a high speed blender and then fermented in the Instant Pot.
            The long awaited post is finally here. Ever since I shared my dosa batter on Instagram stories, 
            I had so many requests from my readers to share the batter recipe on the blog.
            Sorry, it took me a while guys but here it is finally here- the only recipe that you need to make crispy dosa at home!
            I have already shared my go-to Idli Dosa Batter on the blog before. 
            I often make that batter when I want to use the same batter for idlis, dosa, uttapam.

            <li>1/4 cup refined oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the batter and ferment overnight</li>
            <li>Prepare the potato filling for Masala Dosa</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For making that perfect batter for dosa, use short grain or parboiled rice. This will make your dosa crispier.</li>
            <li>To attain that golden colour to your dosa, use dry roasted chana dal in your batter.</li>
            <li>For better and quick fermentation, try using 1-2 tbsp of methi seeds and put your batter in a warm place. This will also make your dosa tastier.</li>
            <li>You might have seen dosa makers sprinkling water on the hot pan and then making the dosa. Don't perform this on the non-stick pan, as it can affect the coating.</li>
            <li>Always use ghee or butter for making your Masala Dosa as this will increase the flavour.</li>
        </ul>
