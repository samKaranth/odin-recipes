        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe was my family's go-to lasagna recipe growing up, and it's just about the easiest lasagna you'll ever make.
            If you're craving a plate of meaty, cheesy pasta comfort food, this lasagna absolutely delivers. It's totally foolproof and easy. 
            There's no cutting needed, and you can get almost all the ingredients pre-made, pre-shredded, and ready to go.
            It's a crowd-pleaser. Everyone loves a perfect cheesy slice of lasagna.
            It makes a ton. This dish is perfect for potlucks and parties (when those are safe to have again) and fantastic for freezing. 
            Lasagna is one of the few pasta dishes that freeze really well, so if you're a small household, 
            you can stock your freezer with a ton of food fast.
