        <h3>Aren't food the best thing happened to you in life?</h3>

        <p>Every foodie loves the prospect of eating the traditional food around the world, 
        trying a new flavor on for size for the first time or finally getting to savor that uniquely traditional dish you've been hearing about.
        It's our favorite thing to do and the genuine pleasure of culinary travel — traveling to the world's best countries for food and 
        letting your palate guide the way.</p>

        <img src="./images/food.jpeg" alt="food images">
        <p>What's equally fun with food travel is when you get to the point where you have some culinary experience 
        — where patterns begin to emerge and you take note of similarities among ingredients, dishes, cultural expressions, 
        cooking techniques, geography, and other influencing factors. Little by little, the more we eat our way around the world, 
        the better our understanding of the world becomes. And yet…the more those food stories become global and bound together, 
        the more regionally defined they are….once again leading us to feel like first time foodies all over again — a pleasant conundrum. 
        Thankfully there's always what lies ahead… a new food experience to enjoy, another dish to be devoured. So let's eat the world, 
        my culinary friends, in 50 famous and traditional dishes, starting in the good old USofA!</p>
